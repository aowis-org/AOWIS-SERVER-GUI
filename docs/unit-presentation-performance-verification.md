# Unit presentation performance verification — finishing roadmap Step 8

**Input baseline:** `gui(20261011-165505).zip`; 11 October 2026. The user reported **21/21 Linux `aowis` CTest tests passed** (0.63 s) after fixing the Step-7 test compilation issue. The report did not establish whether both Debug and Release passed. This document describes a benchmark added in this patch. **A synthetic benchmark run from the user's Linux machine was subsequently supplied; real application map, Windows and browser WebAssembly performance measurements remain unavailable.** Do not mark Step 8 fully verified until those results are collected.

## Run benchmarks with visible results

The dedicated runner builds only the benchmark targets and executes all CTest
cases labeled `performance` **with verbose output**. CTest normally hides
stdout from passing tests; this runner prints each JSON measurement in the
terminal, followed by the test result. Use Release for comparative timing;
Debug is useful for correctness and diagnostics.

```sh
./compile_linux_benchmarks.sh             # Release; shows benchmark JSON
./compile_linux_benchmarks.sh --debug     # Debug
./compile_linux_benchmarks.sh --both      # Debug followed by Release
```

It reuses `build-linux-tests-debug` and `build-linux-tests-release` so it does
not require separate configurations. CMake's `aowis-benchmarks` target collects
benchmark executables; future benchmarks should be added to that target and
registered with the `performance` CTest label. `compile_linux_tests.sh` retains
the full regular test workflow. Benchmark timings are reported, **not** used as
fixed pass/fail thresholds.

## Automated CTest benchmark (also runnable standalone)

The benchmark source is `tests/unit_presentation_performance_benchmark.cpp`. It uses real Qt Widgets, the current production `UnitPresentationContext`, `UnitAwareView`, and `UnitTablePresentation` paths with **synthetic canonical data**. It does not construct actual EPANET networks or query the database and cannot measure the QRhi/WebGL map renderer.

From the GUI repository root (Qt 6 and the Model submodule required):

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-linux-tests-release -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-linux-tests-release --target aowis-unit-presentation-benchmark --parallel
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./build-linux-tests-release/aowis-unit-presentation-benchmark | tee unit-presentation-benchmark-release.jsonl

cmake -S . -B build-linux-tests-debug -G Ninja -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build-linux-tests-debug --target aowis-unit-presentation-benchmark --parallel
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ./build-linux-tests-debug/aowis-unit-presentation-benchmark | tee unit-presentation-benchmark-debug.jsonl
```

The benchmark **is registered with CTest** under the `aowis` and `performance` labels, and the `aowis-tests` target builds it. Therefore `./compile_linux_tests.sh`, including `--both`, runs it automatically: **22 tests per configuration** (previously 21). It fails only for deterministic correctness violations, **never** for exceeding a wall-clock time threshold. Running the executable directly, as above, is still useful for saving or comparing JSON timing reports.

The probe performs these operations:

| Scenario | Load | Structural assertion / metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Large virtual table | 100,000 rows × 4 numeric columns, fixed viewport 1024 × 680 | One active-unit switch invalidates read-only display data; inspect `viewport_display_reads`, `viewport_refresh_ms` |
| Viewport format-on-demand | 400,000 *possible* cells | Display-role fetches must be nonzero but below 5% of total cell count (per repaint), proving no full-table reformatting |
| Many hidden unit subscribers | 250 inactive child views | Zero hidden callbacks for 500 profile changes, then exactly one callback per region upon activation |
| Visible updates | 500 profile changes (metric/customary alternating) | One refresh per change for the visible table; report notification elapsed time |
| Precision/read-only model | Selected synthetic canonical measurements | Values unchanged across every profile change; no setter exists in the synthetic model |
| Post-burst repaint | Same viewport | Still visible-cell-only formatting; report repaint elapsed time |

The output is a machine-readable single-line JSON object with timings in **milliseconds**, callbacks, and counts. Compare the **same machine, build type, Qt version, viewport, and offscreen platform** across revisions. Prefer medians of several runs after a warm-up. Never impose hard millisecond limits in CTest; evaluate regressions against a measured baseline, including responsiveness observed in the real application. The `canonical_writes: 0` output describes the *synthetic read-only table only*, not production hydraulic model writes.

If the benchmark's structural assertions fail, investigate why a refresh is touching hidden regions, repeatedly invalidating rows or formatting an entire table. If only timings rise, profile before changing data structures.

## Required production performance acceptance (not covered by the synthetic benchmark)

Use an existing large project or generate a **representative large hydraulic network** with many junctions, pipes, Demand Points and simulation result values. Record the dataset counts, CPU, RAM, OS, Qt version, renderer (CPU/QRhi/WebGL), build type and run date.

1. **One visible inspector:** Switch between metric and US display units several times; confirm only the inspector's presentation changes. Count canonical `HydraulicData`/revision writes (target zero) and no undo entries.
2. **Large entity table:** Keep a scrolled/sorted table open. Profile role requests, paints, filter state and unit-change latency; verify only viewport cells need new formatting and canonical sorting/filter bounds remain unchanged.
3. **Hidden tabs and dialogs:** Switch profiles many times while inactive, then activate each tab once. Count display refreshes (zero while hidden, one catch-up per presentation region). Test nested pages and destroyed widgets.
4. **Map Monitor 2D and 3D:** Compare frame times, label regeneration, overlay/heatmap data rebuild counts, QRhi resource recreation, and topology/geometry/terrain cache rebuilds. **Display-unit-only changes should cause zero geometry/network/terrain rebuilds and zero simulation runs.** Do not infer these values from the synthetic benchmark.
5. **Map Editor and simulation statistics/plots:** Test active and hidden states, cursor/legend/axis unit updates, and preserve camera state and solver results. Measure CPU time and unintended model writes.
6. **WebAssembly in a real browser:** Change units while both Qt and JavaScript map labels are visible. Confirm matching scales without tile reload, no WebGL geometry rebuild, and acceptable frame latency; use browser performance tooling.
7. **Native Windows:** Repeat at least the inspector, large-table, and map measurements on the target backend.

Collect structured results, with a before/after or reproducible baseline, for each renderer and target platform. If data collection is impossible, record **unverified** rather than reporting success.

## Acceptance status

| Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Lazy unit-generation behavior and precision invariants | Covered by existing regression tests; user's latest report: 21/21 pass |
| Synthetic 100k-row virtualized table + 250 hidden views + 500 changes | **Linux benchmark executed**; structural checks passed. Viewport refresh 10.890 ms, notifications 5.614 ms, hidden catch-up 4.603 ms, post-burst repaint 8.107 ms (single run; no cross-machine threshold) |
| Debug/Release performance comparison on Linux | Pending actual measurements |
| Production map geometry/terrain rebuild counters | Not instrumented by this patch; requires profiling application |
| Production hydraulic revision/model write counters | Not instrumented by this patch; requires application run |
| Windows/native browser WASM performance | Pending |

**Step 8 status:** The synthetic benchmark has passed in a direct Linux run: 100,000 rows × 4 columns, 250 hidden views, 500 changes, 120 display-role reads per viewport, zero premature hidden refreshes, and 250 catch-up refreshes. It is now included as the **22nd regular Linux CTest** and is built by `aowis-tests`. This patch requires a new 22-test suite run for confirmation. Final *production* performance sign-off still needs the real application measurements above. The Step-9 [acceptance ledger](unit-system-final-acceptance.md) records the blocking evidence. **Step 9 (final audit/sign-off) must not treat this step as complete merely because the benchmark target compiles.**
