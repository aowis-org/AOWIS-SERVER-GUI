# Projects workspace — interaction contract

**Normative product design.** The Projects workspace implements the
[DVMDB version-control model](../../AOWIS-SERVER-DVMDB/docs/version-control-semantics.md)
and [graph presentation](project-graph-layout.md). A database connection,
project, branch, committed revision and private working copy are **different
objects** with different lifecycles and actions.

## Workspace responsibilities

| Region | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Database navigator | List saved embedded/REST source profiles and their availability and visibility |
| Project / branch navigator | Navigate projects and branches within the selected visible databases |
| History canvas | Show one Git-style immutable commit DAG with branch HEAD labels |
| Right inspector | Show selected identity, context-specific information tabs and permitted actions |
| Model editor | Edit one private working copy in the user's configured personal DVMDB; never edit a committed revision |

The database selector remains visible even when a source has no projects.
Unchecking a database filters it from the canvas and project tree; it is not
an implicit disconnect/delete operation. Multiple visible databases remain
source-qualified so equal human-readable names never collide.

The inspector uses the shared `Sizes::SidebarRightWidth` sizing convention,
not a half-window layout. Optional tab pages are hidden when inactive, and
selection of another object changes the inspector without a modal duplicate.

## Working repository versus published database sources

Each user has one configured **personal working DVMDB** for durable drafts,
local commits and tracking of shared branches. Standalone uses its built-in
native DVMDB; basic desktop and web clients require an explicit private
HTTP DVMDB repository. A visible/selected shared project source is **not**
the working repository. The GUI must distinguish Save draft, Commit locally,
and Publish/Push to shared HEAD. See
[working-repository configuration](working-repository-configuration.md).

## Creation and opening

### Database/source profile

Creating a profile chooses embedded/REST and connection information. This
manages the GUI profile, **not** database project history. Selecting a source
opens Overview/Connection/Projects inspector tabs. A profile can be removed
without deleting its remote/native database.

### Project

`Create project` allocates a project UUIDv7 and its default `main` branch
UUIDv7. The branch is **unborn**: no committed HEAD revision and no synthetic
R0. Show the project and branch immediately with `No commits yet`. To edit,
start a private working copy from the project's empty model state. A user
must explicitly commit to create the first immutable revision.

### Branch

`Create branch` requires an explicit **committed source revision**.
An unborn `main` must receive its first successful commit before any branch
can be created from it. If a source branch is selected, display its
committed HEAD and retain both `originBranchId` and exact `forkRevisionId`.
The form must not silently pick a remembered branch or a different root.

If the user has uncommitted edits, offer `Commit first` or `Branch from last
commit (without my edits)`; do not silently finalize, copy or discard private
changes. Branch creation from a committed revision does **not** create an
extra revision. Branch labels may include spaces and valid UTF-8, with
validation aligned to DVMDB rather than an ASCII-only GUI regex.

## Working-copy editor

A session checks out a **separate private working copy** from a fixed base
revision UUIDv7 (or `null` for the unborn initial branch). Each working copy
has its own UUIDv7, owner/session and target branch. Different users may
check out the same branch and base concurrently. Only their own working
copies are editable; the shared committed HEAD is always immutable.

The editor must display the target branch, its **current committed HEAD**,
its **pinned working-copy base**, dirty state and validation errors. It must
preserve uncommitted changes through safe navigation and service errors.
Opening a historical revision for inspection must not move a branch HEAD;
editing historical content requires an explicit checkout/fork workflow.

### Commit

`Commit locally` submits the whole validated model state or a deterministic
change set to the user's **personal DVMDB**, with exact expected **local**
branch HEAD/null, target local branch and an idempotency key. Success creates
one immutable revision UUIDv7 and advances only its local branch HEAD.

`Publish` transmits verified immutable commits to the shared project
repository and conditionally advances the **shared** branch HEAD. An
explicitly null expected remote HEAD is required on first publication.
A successful local commit is never undone by rejected or timed-out Publish.

If the local HEAD changed before Commit or the shared HEAD changed before
Publish, show which **local or shared branch advanced**, preserving both
private drafts and all successful local commits. Offer compare/reconcile,
rebase or explicit merge resolution. Never automatically reset another
user's work, force-publish, or blindly retry a timed-out write. A HEAD
mismatch is an optimistic-concurrency collision and might or might not be
an overlapping model-data conflict. Validate the complete hydraulic network
before publishing a reconciled commit.

## Inspector tabs and actions

| Selection | Contextual tabs | Principal actions |
|---|---|---|
| Database | Overview, Connection, Projects | Create project, refresh |
| Project | Overview, Branches, Networks | Start working copy, create branch |
| Branch | Overview, Revisions, Working copies | Checkout, create branch from committed HEAD, compare/merge |
| Committed revision | Overview, Parents/History, Snapshot | Inspect, compare, branch from this finalized revision |
| Private working copy | Overview, Model, Changes/Validation | Edit, commit, reconcile, discard with confirmation |

Only show tabs with implemented, meaningful content. Creation forms live
**inside** the inspector, with validation, Cancel and explicit source context;
they are not permanent Creation tabs or separate modal inspectors. Dangerous
operations require appropriate confirmation and permissions.

The `Created from` field displays source **branch UUIDv7** and exact immutable
**fork revision UUIDv7**, not just the source's current moving HEAD. It is
metadata rather than a second edge in history. The revision inspector shows
full revision UUID, ordered parent IDs and SHA-256 verification metadata.

## Graph and terminology

The canvas draws a **Git-style single committed revision DAG with branch
labels and optional visual lanes**, not branch-owned duplicate histories; see
[graph rules](project-graph-layout.md). It must not draw a branch as a
revision leaf, treat an editable working copy as a committed revision, or
connect the same branch with both a HEAD edge and a creation-origin edge.
Several branches can reference one committed revision. Their future commits,
not their creation events, create a true history fork.

User-facing labels:

- **Branch:** stable named development line.
- **HEAD:** latest **committed** revision of that branch, or `No commits yet`.
- **Revision / Commit:** immutable finalized whole-model snapshot.
- **Working copy:** editable state owned by the user/session, not a revision.
- **Save draft:** persist uncommitted edits in the personal working DVMDB.
- **Commit:** create one immutable commit and advance a **local** branch HEAD.
- **Publish:** conditionally advance the shared repository's branch HEAD
  after verified history transfer.
- **Branch from here:** create a branch from this committed snapshot, without
  creating another snapshot.

## Native and REST parity

Both backends must supply real UUIDv7 project, branch, revision and
working-copy IDs; immutable SHA-256 metadata; nullable unborn HEADs;
branch provenance; ordered revision ancestry; consistent paginated graphs;
and explicit optimistic conflict semantics. Never invent UUIDs in the GUI,
assume a revision exists when a branch is unborn, or quietly fall back to
a mismatched identity format.

All model/session operations must use a source-qualified project ID.
Asynchronous responses must be tied to the request generation and selection;
late results may not overwrite newer data. Source outages leave drafts
recoverable and persisted catalogues visibly stale, not silently writable.

## Acceptance

- Empty newly created project displays `main` but no revision card.
- User A and user B independently check out and edit `main` at R7.
- A commits locally and publishes R8; B may commit locally from R7, but
  B's stale Publish is rejected without losing local commits or drafts.
- Creating a feature branch from R7 keeps that exact fork point and does
  not create a new revision.
- Committing independently to `main` and `feature` creates the actual fork
  in the revision graph; no arbitrary dashed origin edge is drawn.
- Graph selection, filter, refresh, inspector tabs and camera manipulation
  never move a committed HEAD or change private drafts.

This is the required workspace behavior; implementation and tests must be
brought into conformity with it before checkout/commit is released.
