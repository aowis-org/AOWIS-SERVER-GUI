// how far the node is foreshortened as seen from the eye.
//
// The quadtree measures a node by the projected size of its bounding
// sphere, the same from every direction, so a node seen at a grazing angle
// towards the horizon was refined as if seen head-on: its cells came out several pixels wide but a
// fraction of a pixel tall (the moiré in the wireframe, most of the
// triangles of a tilted view). On screen such a node is foreshortened along
// the view by the cosine between its surface normal and the direction to the
// eye; the weight is the square root of that cosine, the geometric mean of
// the unchanged width and the shortened height, so neither the imagery's
// horizontal sharpness nor the mesh's vertical density goes far off. The
// node then becomes a coarser imagery leaf, which draws a coarser DEM tile
// at its full resolution (MapGlobeTerrainLevels): the terrain follows.
//
// The normal is the geocentric direction of the node's centre (within a
// fraction of a degree of the ellipsoid normal; relief is ignored). A node
// whose sphere comes close to the eye spans many viewing angles, so the
// centre's angle says little there: within two radii the weight is 1, and
// it blends to the centre's angle by four radii. The weight never drops
// below MapGlobeQuadtreeMinimumForeshortening.
